  Project Setup
<h1>
<hr>
<h3 align="center">
  Communications
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
  All communications for this project will be conducted via Slack and Discord.
</p>
<p>
  Weekly sprint meetings will be held over Slack, such that the project supervisors (the TA and professor) can join and/or monitor the attendance of each meeting.
</p>
<p>
  All other project related information will be sent and conveyed via Discord, as it is a much quicker way of sending and receiving information in a timely manner.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, all tickets and sprints will be organized and directed on Jira. Any tasks, bug fixes or stylations will be added through a ticket system hosted in the Jira board <code>CSCC01 Project</code>.
</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center">
  GitHub
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
  The GitHub project is setup to have all sprint folders under <code>doc/sprint#</code> where <code>#</code> is the numbered sprint. To make matters really simple, and to always have a working version of out app, each branch from the main branch will be labeled as <code>sprint#</code> where <code>#</code> is the sprint number, and each task for the sprint branch will have a sub-branch of its own with the ticket number associated with the Jira board.
</p>
<p>
  All pull request must be peer reviewed and approved by at least two (2) of the other members. The merge must be compressed into a single commit using squash to be accepted at all. Bugs or unfinished components of a merged branch will be created into another ticket to be completed.
</p>
<p>
  Since neither GitHub flow or Jira integrations for GitHub are utilized, tickets and branches must be created manually. As such, all tickets on Jira and sub-branches on GitHub will be directly equivalent.
</p>
