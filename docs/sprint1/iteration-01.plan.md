## Iteration 1

 * Start date: Monday, June 5th, 2023
 * End date: Friday, June 16th, 2023

## Process
#### Roles & responsibilities

For our first sprint, we will have the following roles and responsibilities:

Anna: Front-end, specifically focusing on implementing the login and password reset UI and functionality.

Ethan: Front-end, focusing on implementing dashboards for students, employers, and admins

Jason: Back-end, focussing on the design and implementation of the initial student registration, user login, and password reset endpoints.

Miles: Front-end, focusing on creating all the components for each page and routing them accordingly

Junlin:  Back-end, focusing on implementing employer registration, plus designing school and company objects.

#### Events
All of our meetings will be held online through Slack/Discord. We will have standups on Mondays at 3 pm, Wednesdays at 11 am, and Fridays at 1 pm. We will also have a planning session on the first Monday of each sprint, right after our standup, and a review session on the Thursday before the sprint deadline. If our team requires extra meetings, they will be scheduled on a need-be basis. 

#### Artifacts
We will use JIRA to track all the tasks we must finish during the sprint. During our planning meeting, we discussed which tickets were a priority based on what functionality will be used the most. With the JIRA tickets, each team member can pick up any ticket they want to work on, provided they can finish it within the sprint. 

## Product
#### Goals and tasks

For our first sprint, the goal is to allow users to register and have access to all the different pages on our website. The main focus will be creating each page and implementing routing for each user. For example, a student should be able to register, log in, and view all the student dashboard pages. 

In order to meet our goal, we will be working on seven user stories in order of most to least important:
1. Student Registration
2. Employer Registration
3. User Login
4. Student Dashboard
5. Employer Dashboard
6. Admin Dashboard
7. Password Reset

Each user story will be split into tasks which any team member can pick up and work on. The priority will be to complete the back-end features first, alongside the routing of pages. Afterwards, the UI and its logic will be implemented. 

#### Artifacts

By the end of the sprint, our team shall have a completed login, password reset, and registration page and the UI for every other page on our website. In order to have this, we will also have the back-end capabilities to register students and employers, log in for all user types, and reset their passwords. Working on these artifacts first will allow us to efficiently work on the features we have planned, as once we have the users logged in, we can test how they would interact with the different dashboards.
