# YourScope | Wenduo Sky
## Iteration IV - Review & Retrospect
This meeting took place on Friday, August 4, 2023 at 5:35PM. The meeting was held online through Discord.
## Process - Reflection
After learning from the mistakes from the previous three iterations, we were able to apply all the lessons learned to our final iteration. Below are the observations that Wenduo Sky had during this iteration.
#### Successful Decisions
* Ensured that pull requests were properly communicated and understood for all group members
	* Through a concerted team effort, we successfully facilitated clear and thorough communication during the pull request phase for all group members. By meticulously overseeing the process, we ensured that each team member had a comprehensive understanding of the pull requests. This collaborative approach fostered efficiency and harmony within our workflow, maintaining transparency and cohesion throughout the project. As a result, our collective dedication led to successful outcomes and strengthened working relationships within the team.
#### Unsuccessful Decisions
* Work was not distributed evenly throughout the given time frame
	* During the project, we encountered the challenge of unevenly distributing the workload within the given time frame. Despite our best efforts and initial plans for equitable allocation, certain tasks ended up being disproportionately assigned, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. Moving forward, we learned valuable lessons, aiming to implement a more systematic approach to workload assessment, encourage open discussions, and establish contingency plans to ensure a balanced distribution of tasks in future projects.
#### Planned Changes
* Address the issue of uneven workload distribution
	* We will conduct a thorough assessment of task complexity and time requirements during the project planning phase, ensuring a more accurate and equitable allocation of responsibilities. Regular check-ins and open communication channels will be established to encourage team members to express their workloads and share concerns proactively. 
	* To handle unexpected changes in project scope, we will create a flexible contingency plan that allows for task reallocation without causing significant disruptions. By learning from our past experiences and implementing these changes, we aim to promote a more balanced and productive workload distribution in future projects, enhancing team dynamics and overall project success.
