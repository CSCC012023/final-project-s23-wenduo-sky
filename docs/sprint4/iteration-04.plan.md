## Iteration IV - Planning Meeting Summary
* **Start Date**: Monday, July 24th, 2023
* **End Date**: Friday, August 4th, 2023
## Process
The fourth iteration of our project, which started on Monday, July 24th, 2023, and ended on Friday, August 4th, 2023, focused on establishing several main features for the user and completing tasks left unfinished from the previous sprint. The primary emphasis was on front-end development, with the team successfully accomplishing all planned objectives. All members of the team attended the meeting. That is, Anna Chester, Ethan Zhang, Jason Su, Junlin Qu, and Miles Bernstein.
#### Previous Iteration Changes
Below are the most significant changes that the team plans to make to the process.
* Communicate when pull requests are made.
	* Implement a pull request review policy with clear turnaround time expectations for reviewers. Assign specific reviewers to each pull request and encourage proactive communication. Set up automated reminders and monitor the review process for bottlenecks. Measure the average review time by summing review times for all pull requests and dividing by the total number of pull requests in the iteration. Obtain feedback from team members on the effectiveness of the review process.
#### Roles & Responsibilities
* Anna: Front-end, focusing on adding the prerequisite and recommended courses for students, plus general UI enhancements.
* Ethan: Front-end, focusing on various UI enhancements and bugfixes.
* Jason: Back-end and front-end with main focus on improving the look and feel of the front-end UI, but also worked on some backend endpoints to retrieve the total number of programs stored in the database.
* Miles: Back-end, focusing on managing relationship between database and backend, creating endpoints for all tasks, and web scraping for data entries.
* Junlin: Front-end, focusing on front-end logic for student job applications, student event viewings and employers creating and deleting job postings.
#### Events
All of our meetings will be held online through Discord. We will have standups on Mondays at 3:00PM, Wednesdays at 6:00PM, and Fridays at 1:00PM. We will also have a planning session on the first Monday of each sprint, right after our standup, and a review session on the Thursday before the sprint deadline, preparing ourselves and fixing oversights for the demo. If our team requires extra meetings, they will be scheduled on a need-be basis.
#### Artifacts
We will use JIRA to track all the tasks we must finish during the sprint. During our planning meeting, we discussed which tickets were a priority based on what functionality will be used the most. Furthermore, each story and their corresponding subtasks will be assigned with story points. which will help each team member to prioritize his or her tasks. There will be an initial distribution of some tickets and afterwards, each team member can pick up any ticket they want to work on, provided they can finish it within the sprint.
#### Git Workflow
All work will be done based on a new branch named 'sprint4', which is branched from 'main'. By the end of the sprint, 'sprint4' will be merged into 'main'. Each feature, or subtask, will be branched from 'sprint2' and the name of the branch should corresponding with its ticket ID (e.g. YS-69). When a feature is finished, a pull request is made to merge the branch into 'sprint4'. In order for merging, at least ONE other team member will be required to review it. If everything seems to be in order and there is no conflicting code, the reviewer can approve of the pull request and then the requester will be allowed to merge. Otherwise, a comment can be made regarding in the work or changes can be requested. Naming conventions for commits and merges will follow the format provided in the course (e.g. feat: Implementation or fix: Bugfix). This system that the team has chosen will ultimately reduce code conflicts and bugs. Furthermore, the naming conventions will make it clear which branch is meant for which ticket and when merging, reviewers will understand what they are looking for.
## Product
#### Goals and tasks
For the third sprint, the goal is to give users access to some more base features to the application as well as completing previous tickets that were unfinished. The main focus will be implementing various front-end features for important operations. For example, a student will be able to create their own profile and then apply to jobs.
In order to meet the goal, the team will be working on five user stories in order of most to least important:
1. Student Cover Letter Builder
2. Student View Post-Secondary Options
3. Student Course Suggestions
4. Student View/Add Courses to Schedule
5. Front-end UI Enhancements

Each user story was split into tasks that team members could pick up and work on. The priority was to complete back-end features first and then implement the user interface and its logic.
#### Artifacts
By the end of the sprint, the team should have successfully established several core features related to student profiles, course management, and UI enhancements. The project now boasts robust back-end capabilities that retrieve required data from the database, coupled with an intuitive user interface for all users. These achievements allowed the team to make final user interface revisions for the project.
